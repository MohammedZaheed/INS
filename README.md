Implemented Ciphers
Caesar Cipher - A simple substitution cipher that shifts characters by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Monoalphabetic Cipher - A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter from a fixed shuffled alphabet.

Playfair Cipher - A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters using a 5x5 matrix.

Hill Cipher - A polygraphic substitution cipher based on matrix multiplication.

Vigen√®re Cipher - A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that encrypts text using a repeating keyword-based shifting technique.

Feistel Cipher - A symmetric encryption algorithm that splits plaintext into two halves and processes them through multiple rounds using a round function, key, and XOR operations. It forms the basis of many modern block ciphers like DES
